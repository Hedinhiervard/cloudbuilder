# cloudbuilder
Native C++ SDK for Clan of the Cloud

In order to compile, you need the delivery directory. You can obtain it by checking out the cloudbuilder-tools repository and putting it side-by-side with the cloudbuilder repository on your local machine. Compiling all the sub-projects will put their results ready for use in a directory cloudbuilder-tools/../cloudbuilder/delivery.

In order to get started quickly, you can download a precompiled version on the Google Drive. This file may be updated often, it is currently dated from Sun, Dec 6 of 2015.
