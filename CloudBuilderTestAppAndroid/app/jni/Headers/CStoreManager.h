		   application or fetched from a previous call to #FetchProductInformation.
		 * @result if noErr, the json passed to the handler may contain:
		 - "validation" (object): status of purchase
		   - "ok" (number): 1 if the purchase has been done properly (should always be the case).
		   - "repeated" (number): 1 if the purchase has been considered as a duplicate. This means
		     that the order was already processed previously and the reward associated with the
		     purchase was not given. This does not necessarily means that there was a piracy attempt
		     or that the reward was never given; it might simply be that the order was validated on
		     the server and the transaction executed, but the client did not get the answer at the
		     time, thus trying again.
		   - "purchase" (optional object): information about the purchase made. Only supplied in
		     case of successful purchase. If the purchase was already validated before (repeated
			 transaction), this field is only available if the purchase was made by the same user
			 as now. It is omitted in other cases.

			 You might want to use it for customer service. Depends on the store type and might
			 not be supplied in case of a repeated transaction that was made by another user.
